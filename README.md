BORED is a simple drawing application for android that can be used as a standalone application for note taking
and doodling. 

Alternatively, BORED can be coupled with the NIOS II application to facilitate an interactive learning 
environment where students can answer questions posed by an instructor using an FPGA connected to a monitor and vice versa.
